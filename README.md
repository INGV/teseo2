# Teseo2: Turn the Eldest Seismograms into the Electronic Original Ones

Teseo2 is a software tool for quick and accurate digitization/vectorization of seismogram traces from raster files.

It has been developed in the framework of the Sismos project [Michelini and the Sismos Team, 2005] at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (Italy). This name was inspired by the myth of Theseus and it is also an acronym for 

**T**urn the **E**ldest **S**eismograms into the **E**lectronic **O**riginal **O**nes.

Teseo2 is a plug-in for [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - *GNU Image Manipulation Program* - that extends its functionalities for seismological studies. The GIMP is a multiplatform photo manipulation tool freely distributed. It works on many operating systems, in many languages.

Teseo2 allows primarily for:

  - additional operations on the vectorized trace (i.e. resampling and alignment)
  - supervised vectorization algorithms (colour weighted mean)
  - analysis after trace vectorization, such as curvature correction and time realignment
  - trace import/export in several formats (such as SAC, SVG, DXF, ASCII, Timemarks distances).

In order to keep track of the stages and parameters of a seismogram vectorization, Teseo2 is able to write this information into the image saved into GIMP's native [XCF](https://fileinfo.com/extension/xcf) file type.

Teseo2 is developed following the "Open-Source" philosophy and it is freely distributed under GPL license. It is cross-platform and the sources, the binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, are periodically updated on the Sismos web site.

## Using Teseo by Docker (recommended)

We recommend to run Teseo by Docker in a Unix-like environment (Linux or Mac OS X).

We tested the new docker installation on Linux and Mac OS X. We have not had a chance to test the docker installation on Windows as well. But with an X server, an ssh client and a few other little tweaks it should work.

### Installation and use Teseo by Docker

#### Requirements

  - **Docker** (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)
    - [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
  - **X11 server**
    - Mac OS X: Xquartz - [https://www.xquartz.org/](https://www.xquartz.org/)
    - **Important note for XQuartz**: in *XQuartz* Preferences, within *"Security"* tab, you have to check the option *"Allow connections from network clients"*.
  - **git**
    - Mac OS X: Xcode - `xcode-select --install`
  - **make**
    - Mac OS X: Xcode - `xcode-select --install`

#### Optional packages

  - **ssh client**
    - *ssh client* is only required for running Teseo Docker Image by `make -f Makefile.Docker run_ssh_xhost` (see below the option based on *ssh* and *xhost*).

#### Download teseo2 repository
 
```
git clone https://github.com/INGV/teseo2.git
cd teseo2
```

#### Build Docker Image

Edit the file `Makefile.Docker.env` and set properly the following custom variables:

```sh
######################################
# Custom variables
######################################

#Dockerfile
DOCKERBASEIMAGE=alpine
DOCKERFILE=Dockerfile.$(DOCKERBASEIMAGE)

# Custom SSH port used to access to docker container
SSH_CONTAINER_PORT = 10022

# User ID and Group ID for teseo user and group.
# WARNING: On Linux, if you run docker image by different UID or GID
# you could not able to write in docker mount data directory.
# If you want always add new teseo user and group set ENV_UID and ENV_GID to zero.
ENV_UID=`id -u`
ENV_GID=`id -g`
# ENV_UID=0
# ENV_GID=0

# Default docker mount data directory
BASEMOUNTDIR = `pwd`/DockerMount

# X11 Server Hostname or IP
# Try to catch docker host IP when running run_xhost
MYIP = `ifconfig | grep -w inet | egrep -v -w "127.0.0.1" | awk '{print $$2}' | head -n 1`
# You can manually set
# MYIP = X11_server_hostname_or_IP

# Set path where searching xhost command
XHOST_PATH = /usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/opt/X11/bin
```

Then run:

```
make -f Makefile.Docker build
```

#### Run Docker Image

Teseo Docker Image is based on X11 environment. You need to set up an X11 server on your computer.

You can run Teseo Docker Image by one of the following option:

##### 1) Based on X11 local socket.

**WARNING: It works only on Linux**. It does not work on Mac OS X!

```
make -f Makefile.Docker run_xlocal
```

##### 2) Based on *xhost*.

**WARNING: Not when the machine is offline.**

It is not possible running in this mode when you are offline (that is when your Docker host does not have any visible IP from docker container).

When you run this mode, you have to disable the access control to your X11 server, clients can connect from any host. Run `xhost +` or `make -f Makefile.Docker xhost_disable_control`.

Run:

```
# OPTIONAL:
#    xhost +
#    make -f Makefile.Docker xhost_disable_control

make -f Makefile.Docker run_xhost
```

##### 3) Based on *ssh* and *xhost*.

**NOTE: This is the general solution.**

This solution should work on all cases:

  - it is more general than previous based on *xhost*
  - it is safer because enable access control only to the localhost machine. Run `xhost +localhost` or `make -f Makefile.Docker xhost_add_localhost`
  - and you can run also when your machine is offline.

Before you start, you have to run the docker container as an SSH server service by:

```
# OPTIONAL:
#    xhost +localhost
#    make -f Makefile.Docker xhost_add_localhost

make -f Makefile.Docker start
```

Then run:

```
make -f Makefile.Docker run_ssh_xhost
```

Note: when you finished to use the docker container remember to stop it by:

```
make -f Makefile.Docker stop
```


#### Update Docker Image

To update your Teseo Docker Image pull the changes from `git` repository and rebuild by `make`.

```
cd teseo2
git pull
```

Rebuild

```
make -f Makefile.Docker build
```


## General Build from scratch

### Requirements

  - gimp-2.2.9 up to gimp-2.10.x

The configure scripts might fail asking you the dependency libraries you have to install or to specify into PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH.

### Quick installation

```
$ tar xzvf teseo*.tar.gz
$ cd teseo2/
$ cd gtk-addons
$ ./configure && make && sudo make install
$ cd ../newuoa
$ ./configure F77=<fortran-path> && make && sudo make install
$ cd ../teseo-2
$ ./configure && make && sudo make install
```
