This package is a plug-in for GIMP 2 capable of vectorize seismic trace from
historical seismogram acquired in raster format.

NEWUOA - NEWUOA is a software developed by M.J.D.
	Powell for unconstrained optimization without derivatives. 
	Author: M.J.D. Powell (mjdp@cam.ac.uk)
cfortran.h - cfortran.h is an easy-to-use powerful bridge between C and FORTRAN.
	It provides a transparent, machine independent interface between C and FORTRAN routines and global data.

Curvature correction - Curvature correction of Wiechert records is based on studies and
	Fortran routines developed by Antoine Schlupp. Within Teseo2, Fortran routines have been ported in C. 
	Author: Antoine Schlupp (antoine.schlupp@eost.u-strasbg.fr)


- NEWUOA
Teseo-2 use a library created from the original NEWUOA Fortran files with little changes to permit
call of the routines from C code.

From the original documentation of NEWUOA:

This is the Fortran version of NEWUOA. Its purpose is to seek
the least value of a function F of several variables, when derivatives
are not available, where F is specified by the user through a subroutine
called CALFUN. The algorithm is intended to change the variables to values
that are close to a local minimum of F
...
The method is described in the report "The NEWUOA software for unconstrained optimization
without derivatives", which is available on the web at www.damtp.cam.ac.uk, where
you have to click on Numerical Analysis and then on Reports, the number
of the report being NA2004/08
...
There are no restrictions on or charges for its use. If you wish to refer to it,
please cite the DAMTP report that is mentioned above, which has been submitted for
publication in the proceedings of the 40th Workshop on Large Scale Nonlinear
Optimization (Erice, Italy, 2004).

See the README file in NEWUOA Directory for other details.


- CFORTRAN.H
Teseo-2 use cfortran.h to call newuoa routines.

From the original documentation of cfortran.h

cfortran.h is an easy-to-use powerful bridge between C and FORTRAN. It provides a
completely transparent, machine independent interface between C and FORTRAN routines
(= subroutines and/or functions) and global data, i.e. structures and COMMON blocks.
